## I read and write international law theories and histories, sometimes with a focused interest on China and the wider region.
</br>
</br>

## My research sits at the intersection between public international law and development. It has progressed from a particular interest in international economic law through an engagement with treaty interpretation and discourse analysis, to a broader concern with the history and theory of international law through a socio-legal lens, critically redescribing concepts of sovereignty and non-intervention. My doctoral dissertation on the principle of non-intervention led me to delve into developmental intervention, which shapes my current research emphasis on international law and development, particularly with regard to China and Asia.
</br>
</br>

## Currently, I hold an assistant professorship at the University of Macao. I am also a member to the Laureate Research Programme 'Global Corporations and International Law' under the auspices of Professor Sundhya Pahuja, and a research associate to the Oxford-ERC project 'China, Law and Development' led by Professor Matthew Erie. Before joining Macao, I was an awardee of the Swiss National Foundation's post-doctoral mobility research grant. My research topic is 'China, International Development and the Principle of Non-intervention since 1949'.
