## I read and write international law theories and histories, sometimes with a focused interest on China and the wider region.
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;


## My research sits at the intersection between public international law and development. It has progressed from a particular interest in international economic law through an engagement with treaty interpretation and discourse analysis, to a broader concern with the history and theory of international law through a socio-legal lens, critically redescribing concepts of sovereignty and non-intervention. My doctoral dissertation on the principle of non-intervention led me to delve into developmental intervention, which shapes my current research emphasis on international law and development, particularly with regard to China and Asia.
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;


## Currently, I hold an assistant professorship at the University of Macao. I am also a member to the Laureate Research Programme 'Global Corporations and International Law' under the auspices of Professor Sundhya Pahuja, and a research associate to the Oxford-ERC project 'China, Law and Development' led by Professor Matthew Erie. Before joining Macao, I was an awardee of the Swiss National Foundation's post-doctoral mobility research grant. My research topic is 'China, International Development and the Principle of Non-intervention since 1949'.

# Thesis supervision
&nbsp;
- For PhD application:
  I often receive emails from students asking if I could supervise and support their PhD work. 
  For the official rules at my institution, please check it through [the official website](https://grs.um.edu.mo/index.php/prospective-students/doctoral-degrees-programmes/).
&nbsp;
  - My tips are as follows: 
  &nbsp;
    * Plan in advance. Read my research website to see if we are a good match. 
    &nbsp;
    * Please note that I only take PhDs who will write and defend their thesis in English. 
    &nbsp;
    * When sending me application emails, please provide me with the following documents : your CV, a 3-page research proposal (including literature review) and your motivation letter.
&nbsp;
- For master theses:
  Please come to my classes and discuss with me in person before sending me emails. 
  &nbsp;
  I believe in-person exchanges will be more effective. 
  &nbsp;
  Before choosing me as your thesis supervisor, please read my website to see if we are a good match.
