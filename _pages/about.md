<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I read and write international law theories and histories, sometimes with a focused interest on China and the wider region. 

My research sits at the intersection between public international law and development. It has progressed from a particular interest in international economic law through an engagement with treaty interpretation and discourse analysis, to a broader concern with the history and theory of international law through a socio-legal lens, critically redescribing concepts of sovereignty and non-intervention. My doctoral dissertation on the principle of non-intervention led me to delve into developmental intervention, which shapes my current research emphasis on international law and development, particularly with regard to China and Asia.
